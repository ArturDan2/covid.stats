### `Introduction`

Working with this project is the first time i ever worked with API by myself, not including the courses. Also it was my first project i've created using React JS library.

### `General info`

The purpose of this project is to provide basic COVID-19 statistics.

### `Functionality`
User can select the date and country that he wants to the recieve statistics from. This web application can provide basic COVID-19 statistics as.

`Total confirmed cases`

`Confirmed cases on the selected day`

`Total recovered`

`Recovered on the selected day`

`Total deaths`

`Deaths on the selected day`

At some point API i used stopped providing data about recovered cases. I randomized this number to fix this issue and maintain the funcionality of the project for portfolio purposes.


### `Reflection`

In the process of making this project i learnd how to work with external API and how to deal with data fetched from it. I also learned how to deal with errors.
